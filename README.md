# Dart Linked List & Stack Challenges

This project is a Dart console application that solves common data structure challenges using Linked Lists and Stacks

## Features

- Reverse a list using a stack
- Check for balanced parentheses
- Print linked list in reverse order (recursively)
- Find the middle node of a linked list
- Reverse a linked list
- Remove all occurrences of a specific value from a linked list

## ðŸ›  How to Run

1. Install Dart SDK  
   Download and install Dart from: [https://dart.dev/get-dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart)

2. Clone the repository
dart run main.dart

File Structure

â”œâ”€â”€ main.dart             # Main file that runs all challenges
â”œâ”€â”€ exe_stack.dart        # Contains stack-based functions
â”œâ”€â”€ linked_in.dart        # Contains LinkedList logic and challenges


1. Reverse a List (Stack)
   Reverses a list of integers using stack logic.

2. Balanced Parentheses
   Checks whether the provided list of characters has balanced parentheses.

3. Print in Reverse (LinkedList)
   Recursively prints the values in a singly linked list in reverse order.

4. Find the Middle Node
   Finds the middle node of a singly linked list using the slow/fast pointer approach.

5. Reverse a Linked List
   Reverses the linked list by changing the direction of node pointers.

6. Remove All Occurrences
   Removes all occurrences of a specific value from the linked list.
